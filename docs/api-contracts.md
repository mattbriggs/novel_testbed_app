# API: Contracts

Contract generation and serialization.

::: novel_testbed.contracts.contract

This module creates the specification that everything else operates on.  
The contract is the system.

## Assessment Engine

Rule-based narrative validation.

::: novel_testbed.contracts.assessor

::: novel_testbed.contracts.rules

This is where narrative intent becomes falsifiable.  
All future intelligence lives here.

## Design Contract

This API reference is not documentation theater.

It is:

- mechanically generated
- version-controlled
- always consistent with the code

If the API changes, this page changes.  
If this page is wrong, the code is wrong.
