# API: Inference Layer (LLM-backed)

Semantic front-end: Novel → Contract via Reader Response inference.

::: novel_testbed.inference.base

::: novel_testbed.inference.llm_client

::: novel_testbed.inference.llm_inferencer

::: novel_testbed.inference.auto_contract

These modules allow the system to *read* a novel and produce a contract
without author annotation.

They do not replace authorship.  
They expose it.
